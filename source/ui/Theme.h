        The palette, in one place, shared across the house plugins and sampled from the
        Figma files rather than eyeballed -- which is why the values are odd numbers.

        Two rules. Nothing outside this header names a hex value; and the accents are
        named for the job they do rather than for the colour they are, so a change of
        palette does not have to be chased through the call sites.

        The design is two-tone, and that is the thing to hold on to when adding
        anything: the chrome is dark aubergine and the canvas darker still, while the
        panels you reach into are near-white. A new widget has to know which side of
        that line it sits on, because the text colour flips with it.
