        The theme editor: every colour the interface uses, laid out in the groups
        `ThemeRoles.h` puts them in, and a file to carry them between machines.

        Live rather than previewed. A colour changed here reaches the window behind this
        one on the next repaint, because the palette is what everything draws from --
        which means the honest way to judge a colour is to watch the plugin change while
        you drag, and there is no Apply button to forget to press.

        Laid out as a list rather than a grid: the labels are what somebody scans for,
        and a grid of swatches is a colour hunt.
